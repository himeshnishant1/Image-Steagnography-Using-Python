hello to who is reading this readme file.

This Project is about steagnography with image using python.
This is my Final Year Project.

In this projects i have coded two algorithims for encoding text into image (LSB(Lowest Significant Bit) and BPCS(Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation)).

I have also Provided four digits of extra pin to enhance the security.

**Demerits**

It can not run only on RAW images correctly. (some times it works for other images too).

BPCS Alogorithm is working properly but i still cannot decode some data when secret text is bigger like 5000 words.

I have used Tkinter for GUI So don't expect any good looking software like made with JAVA.



-------To launch this project first open this project in the vscode(not necessary) and run the login.py file in terminal.

it will ask for username and password.

username : himesh
password : qwerty123

you can use only raw images.

if you want sample image and sample txt then check out the Input folder.

Note: please install all the required libraries like numpy, OpenCV, tkinter, PIL, matplotlib.pyplot, sqlite. 



You can suggest any changes and also you can add more algorithims to it if you can.
